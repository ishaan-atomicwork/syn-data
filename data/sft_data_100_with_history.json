Free Up Disk Space (you\u2019re at 92 %):\n   \u2022 Empty Recycle Bin and Downloads folder.\n   \u2022 Run Disk Cleanup (type \u201cDisk Cleanup\u201d in the Start menu).\n   \u2022 Aim for at least 15 % free space.\n\n2. Reduce Startup Load:\n   \u2022 Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc \u2192 Startup tab.\n   \u2022 Disable non-essential apps (Teams auto-launch can stay off; you can open it manually).\n\n3. Memory Relief:\n   \u2022 Close unused browser tabs and apps.\n   \u2022 Reboot at least once per day to clear RAM.\n\n4. Updates & Security:\n   \u2022 Windows Update \u2192 Check for updates.\n   \u2022 Dell Command | Update (or Lenovo Vantage / Apple Software Update) for driver & BIOS patches.\n   \u2022 Run a full antivirus scan (your AV definitions are up-to-date).\n\nIf performance is still poor after these, let me know\u2014IT can arrange an SSD upgrade or additional RAM if justified.\n\nAnything else I can clarify?\nUser: Can you check if there are any updates or patches that could help?\nAssistant: Good news \u2013 there are three approved updates that often resolve slow-performance issues:\n\n1. Windows 10 Cumulative Update KB5036977 (OS Build 19045.4412)\n2. Dell Latitude 5420 BIOS 1.27.0\n3.
